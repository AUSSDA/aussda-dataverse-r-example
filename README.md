# AUSSDA Dataverse Example
Shows how to download and run analyses on a data file directly from the AUSSDA Dataverse.
The example uses an open access dataset but it also works with files that require an API key.

We use the Python package pyDataverse by Stefan Kasberger to connect to and download the datafile and Panda and other packages to showcase that data analyses can be done in a browser with a Jupyter Notebook.
